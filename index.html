              The Order of Witchers had almost completely splintered, only a
              small group of witchers remained in its keep after the third group
              of witchers had left to build their own school. These last
              witchers left Morgraig and travelled east. They decided to settle
              in the north in the caves of the Morhen Valley.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 11th century the construction of Kaer Morhen was finished,
              and because its original builders apparently abandoned the keep or
              vanished in some other way, the Wolves settled there.

              School of the Cat is a school of ragtag witchers formed after a
              student mutiny against their former masters. Headquartered in the
              traveling Dyn Marv Caravan, they are apparently one of the few
              schools training women and non-pureblood humans.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cat students hone their balance by walking a tightrope
              blindfolded. Failure is easy to shrug off at first, but throughout
              their training, the walk gets higher and the danger increases.

              School of the Griffin, sometimes referred to as School of the
              Eagle or Gryphon School, is a school of witchers headquartered in
              Kovir and Poviss, in Kaer Seren located at the sea end of a
              mountain range. Leo Bonhart had reportedly slain at least one of
              its members.
            </p>
            <p>
              Students are offered two choices to complete their final trial.
              They either locate and retrieve a griffin's egg, or recite the
              entirety of Liber Tenebrarum verbatim. However, none have ever
              chosen the latter.

              Students must pass the trial of the mountain. This requires
              venturing to the peak of Mount Gorgon to retrieve a special
              runestone as proof of ascent. It was an especially brutal
              challenge as many boys freeze to death long before they find the
              summit.

              of the Continent, and thus remain mostly an enigma to Nordlings.
