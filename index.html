              The Order of Witchers had almost completely splintered, only a
              small group of witchers remained in its keep after the third group
              of witchers had left to build their own school. These last
              witchers left Morgraig and travelled east. They decided to settle
              in the north in the caves of the Morhen Valley.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 11th century the construction of Kaer Morhen was finished,
              and because its original builders apparently abandoned the keep or
              vanished in some other way, the Wolves settled there.
