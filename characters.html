            <h3>Geralt of Rivia</h3>
            <p>
              Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf
              active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress
              Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous
              relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual
              tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities.
              Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens
              which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater
              speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.

            <h3>Yennefer of VENGERBERG</h3>
            <p>
              Yennefer of Vengerberg, born on Belleteyn in 1173, was a sorceress
              who lived in Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn. She was
              Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she
              viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she
              could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.
            </p>
            <p>
              She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a
              formal royal advisor), a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the
              youngest member of the Council of Wizards within the Brotherhood
              of Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted
              to recruit her, but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted
              to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.

              1252 or 1253, and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday. She
              was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr

              After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what
              reward the witcher would like and Geralt invoked the Law of
              Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri,
              unbeknownst to Duny.

            <p>
              Emhyr var Emreis, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd (Nilfgaardian
              language: The White Flame Dancing on the Barrows of his Enemies),
              also known to a few under his alias as Duny, the Urcheon of
              Erlenwald (Polish: Jeż z Erlenwaldu) was Emperor of the
              Nilfgaardian Empire, Lord of Metinna, Ebbing, Gemmera, and
              Sovereign of Nazair and Vicovaro from 1257 until his death
              sometime in the late 13th century. He also became the King of
              Cintra after marrying a false Cirilla in 1268.
            </p>
            <p>
              His rule of Nilfgaard was highly aggressive, often pursuing
              expansionist policies similar to those of his predecessors. This
              led to the outbreak of two wars against the Northern Kingdoms,
              both of which he lost. Emhyr var Emreis was an intelligent and
              brilliant ruler. He chose his people well and crushed many plots
              against him. He was ruthless toward traitors and moved towards his
              goals with great determination.

            <h3>Dandelion (Jaskier)</h3>
            <p>
              Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove, better known as
              Dandelion (Polish: Jaskier), was a poet, minstrel, bard, and close
              friend of Geralt of Rivia.
            </p>
            <p>
              During his travels with Geralt, Dandelion started to write his
              memoirs, entitled "Half a Century of Poetry"; twice, in fact. His
              first attempt was lost in the bottom of the duchess of Toussaint's
              closet after the poet was banished from her duchy. But rather than
              bemoaning that loss, the poet decided to rewrite his memoirs from
              scratch. His poems were later bound in two collections: The
              Adversities of Loving and Time of the Moon. The following are the
              named ones: Elaine Ettariel Elusive The Stars above the Path
              Winter (or The Eternal Fire).
